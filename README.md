# DISTRIBUTE_ESTIMATION_PROJECT
This repository contains the code developed by Edoardo Castioni and Massimiliano Pranzo for the project of the "Intelligent distributed system" of professor Fontanelli.
The project consist in the distributed encirclement of a moving target (person, wheeled robot, ...) via a set of agents that can interact with each other in a confined range. The main problem is to dispose the agents in a predefined (or not) formation and equally spaced. This requirements need the design of two different controller:
  - One for the formation control: this controller exploits the Voroni tasselation in order to consider a confined range of communication and avoid possible obstacles.
  - One for the euqally spacing control: this controller has to be designed via a curviliear abscissa avoiding as much as possible agents "overtakeing"
