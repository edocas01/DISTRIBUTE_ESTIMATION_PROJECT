Distributed convoy for a certain target:
	- A set of vehicles has to protect a sensible moving target accordingly to the einvironment
        - Use GPS for the vehicles and sonar to detect the einvironment (walls)
	- In this case every vehicle can detect the einvironment and select a level of danger
	  in order to have a different disposition of the agents
	- kalman filter of each robot to localize itself plus a kalman filter to localize the target. The control
	  has to be distributed in order to follow the trajectory of the target.
	- possible tests:
			-- see in static condition different shape of perimeter
			-- see in static condition what happens if a new agent is introduced
			-- see if an agent expires (dies)
			-- dynamic performance in case of obstacles (if possible)
Distributed system for autonomous encirclement:
	- A set of vehicles has to guide a group of person/sheep in a specific direction target
	- Use GPS for the vehicles and sonar/UWB/relative measures to track people
