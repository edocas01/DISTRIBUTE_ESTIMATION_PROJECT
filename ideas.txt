Distributed convoy for a certain target:
	- A set of vehicles has to protect a sensible moving target accordingly to the einvironment
        - Use GPS for the vehicles and sonar to detect the einvironment (walls)
	- In this case every vehicle can detect the einvironment and select a level of danger
	  in order to have a different disposition of the agents
	- kalman filter of each robot to localize itself plus a kalman filter to localize the target. The control
	  has to be distributed in order to follow the trajectory of the target.
	- possible tests:
			-- see in static condition different shape of perimeter
			-- see in static condition what happens if a new agent is introduced
			-- see if an agent expires (dies)
			-- dynamic shape according to targe trajectory
			-- USARE GPS o no?

MAIN IDEA:- moving target that follow an unknown trajectory.
	  - each robot has GPS and relative measure system (to distributely localize the target and measure
            distance with other agents)
          - each robot has to do a centralized kalman filter to localize himself
          - each robot has to contribute to a distributed kalman filter to localize the target
          - each robot has to measure the distance with other robots to maintaina certain formation
	  - each robot has to move accordingly to the target recent motion 

			
Distributed system for autonomous encirclement:
	- A set of vehicles has to guide a group of person/sheep in a specific direction target
	- Use GPS for the vehicles and sonar/UWB/relative measures to track people
